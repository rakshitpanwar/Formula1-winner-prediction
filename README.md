# 🏎️ Formula 1 Win Probability Predictor

> Predict the winning probability of any F1 driver for a specific **Grand Prix & Season** using historical race and qualifying data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses **Machine Learning (XGBoost – Tuned with GridSearchCV)** to predict the probability of a driver winning a particular race based on:

- Qualifying position
- Grid position
- Race track (Grand Prix)
- Season (Year)
- Historical performance

## 🧠 Models & Techniques Used

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|
| Data Preprocessing | Merge + Feature Engineering |
| Models Tried | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost |
| Best Model | ✅ XGBoost with Hyperparameter Tuning |
| Evaluation | Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix |
| Final Output | Win probability based on user input |
